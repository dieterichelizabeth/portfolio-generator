# portfolio-generator

Module Project 09 ðŸ“ƒ

This project uses Node.js to build a program that creates an HTML portfolio page without ever touching an HTML file! Instead, the tool/program uses the command line to capture and place user input in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.
